## AI/ML Analysis of TCGA - LUSC | Lung Cancer Gene Expression Dataset
This project uses AI and Machine Learning to classify lung cancer tumors using gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

---

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
The main goal is to build models that can distinguish between normal and tumor samples based on their genetic data.

Data Source: The dataset (LUSCexpfile.csv) contains gene expression levels for various lung cancer samples.

Preprocessing: The data was cleaned, scaled, and reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Models: Several machine learning models were trained and tested, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## ðŸ”¬ About the Dataset
This project uses the TCGA - LUSC (Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma) dataset, which contains gene expression profiles measured by microarray.

About LUSC: Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) is one of the most common and deadliest subtypes of lung cancer. While it can be diagnosed histologically, tumors can also be detected using gene expression profiles.

Dataset Characteristics: The dataset consists of 551 patient samples. For each patient, there are 56,907 different transcripts (expressed genes). The data is imbalanced, with 502 cancer samples and only 49 healthy samples.

Preprocessing: The data has been normalized using TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase Million) to make gene expression levels comparable across different samples.
